#Pin function#
##############

RS			Register select. 0 = instruction register, 1 = data register.
R/W			Read or write mode. Many applications can simply tie this pin to ground.
E			Clock pin.

DB4-DB7		Data pins. Send four bits at a time. We are only going to support 4-bit mode because 8-bit mode is stupid.
DB7			Busy Flag. When RS is 0 and R/W is 1, if DB7 is high the driver's CPU is busy.
